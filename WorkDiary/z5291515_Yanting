Week1

Group formed with Gin, Zhiyue, Yao and Yuemeng. I created the Jira & GitHub accounts. I wrote the user story. I also found and discussed with the team all available software tools and suitable language that we can use for the project.


Week2

I wrote the user story for the Sorting, Banned list, dark/light mode section and attached the corresponding description and the objective that the user story met as part of the proposal and started to design the front-end using conva.
