## Week 1

I created this group with my friends. In order to create a nice group name, I first referred to Microsoft. I am try to named with `something software` Suddenly, I found that the SW in UNSW is exactly `SoftWare`. So the group name was decided.

In the first week, we decided to choose the movie search system. I studied the requirements and design, and wrote [a back-end API document](https://3900w12a-unsoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/589825/API+Design?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZGViY2ZmNTQ2YTcwNDFiZThlZTAyYzc0ZjVhYmM0NGEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9).

## Week 2

I used draw.io to make user operation flow chart and system layers. The front-end members will design the graphical interface according to the flowchart I made.

By the way, I wrote the language technology needed for the front and back ends and referenced the content of external libraries

## Week 3

I have written most of the back-end code, and there are still some new functions and features that need to be added.
The backend is already running normally. I deploy it on my home server with docker at http://lbosau.exlb.org:9900/
