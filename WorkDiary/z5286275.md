## Week 1

I created this group with my friends. In order to create a nice group name, I first referred to Microsoft. I am try to named with `something software` Suddenly, I found that the SW in UNSW is exactly `SoftWare`. So the group name was decided.

In the first week, we decided to choose the movie search system. I studied the requirements and design, and wrote [a back-end API document](https://3900w12a-unsoftware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/589825/API+Design?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZGViY2ZmNTQ2YTcwNDFiZThlZTAyYzc0ZjVhYmM0NGEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9).

## Week 2

I used draw.io to make user operation flow chart and system layers. The front-end members will design the graphical interface according to the flowchart I made.

By the way, I wrote the language technology needed for the front and back ends and referenced the content of external libraries

## Week 3

I have written most of the back-end code, and there are still some new functions and features that need to be added.
The backend is already running normally. I deploy it on my home server with docker at http://lbosau.exlb.org:9900/

## Week 4

I wrote an image related API and added random avatars to all users.  And explained to the front-end how to use the back-end and back-end artifacts. 

## Week 5

In this week's demo, I need to prepare nothing. 

Juliet give me the data. I write a data uploader to upload database and update the data such as score etc.

## Week 6

There are some Problem by using ASP.NET to Show Image. It is slow and sometime cause error. 

So I add a new docker by Nginx at  http://lbosau.exlb.org:9901/. Nginx is use for show Image and it is march faster than ASP.NET.

Everyone is very satisfied with the new image loading speed.

## Week 7

Completed all backend code for Stage2
