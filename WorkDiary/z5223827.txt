Week1:
In the first week, we formed a team and select a project which is movie finder system. 
In the first lab , we think out some novel ideas which probably would be achieved in our further development of the movie finder system. Moreover, 
I came up with some primary user stories that would be used in proposal. My part is to write the user story for the search functionality and movie detail page, 
including the corresponding recommendation list, and a navel idea which is trailers in the front page. On Saturday, we had another meeting that assign further 
tasks to each of our team members.
Week2:
I wrote the full description and how the functionality would satisfy the corresponding project objectives for my part. 
Moreover, I also build some of the storyboards which would show how our site should be interacted with users. 
In the Sunday meeting, we discussed some further details that need to be finished by one or two days.
